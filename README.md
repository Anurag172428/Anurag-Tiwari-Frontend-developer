Task Assignment for building the react app

In PHP rest API we have code to fetch the spacex capsule data. and tihs api is called in the app.js in the react.
src folder contains all the files for react app development. 
This src folder is from react app.
main code is written in app.js and app.css file.
Few links are kept in index.html file.

Rest api url - https://a5theory.com/spacex/read

How to use this code:

if you have running a react proeject in your localhost environment then you just do:

copy app.js code and paste it in your app.js file which is under src folder.

copy app.css code and paste it in your app.css file which is also in src folder.

and now copy index.html code and paste it in your index.html file which is inside the public folder.

and then you can run your project.
